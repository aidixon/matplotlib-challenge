# matplotlib-challenge

Brief detail of this challenge

-Determine the number of unique Mouse ID's and drop duplicated data

-Create a dataframe with the data that had the duplicates dropped and check the unique Mouse ID's within that data

-Calcualte the statistical data for the tumor volume (mm3): mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM. Put it into a dataframe.

-Create a bar and pie chart with the treatment regimen and number of mice using Pandas

-Create a bar and pie chart with the drug treatment and number of mice using MatPlotLib

-Determine the last timepoint for the mice per treatment regimen (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin) 

-Use a for loop to fill in the empty tumor vol data list with the values for the treatment regimens

-Determine potential outliers

-Create a box plot to visually show the outliers

-Use one Mouse ID and its timepoints versus Capomulin to create a line plot

-Use one Mouse ID and its weight/average tumor volume (mm3) versus Capomulin to create a scatter plot

-Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression for mouse weight and average tumor volume (mm3) for Capomulin
