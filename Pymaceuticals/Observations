Observations

-The first observation that can be made is that the scientists that ran this experiment used almost an equal amount of male to female mice ratio. By doing so, the data would be more accurate because they could say that the treatment regimen had similar effects on both genders.

-Looking at the bar chart, there are two treatment regimens that had a near equal amount of mice tested. The rest of the treatment regimens were mostly equal in the amount of mice tested. This shows that while the scientists did want to test a wide range of treatment regimens, the top two that were part of their main focus were Capomulin and Ramicane.

-The bar chart also shows that the scientists tried to pair treatment regimens when they did their testing on the mice. By pairing off the tests, the treatments that may have had similar effects with each other could be seen in the data.
